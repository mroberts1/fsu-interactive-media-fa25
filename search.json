Indeed, they don’t have to settle for models at all.’1 Human behaviour, he writes, can be precisely predicted and controlled with the help of data-driven psychology or sociology. The place of theory is taken by direct correlations between data:\nOut with every theory of human behavior, from linguistics to sociology. Forget taxonomy, ontology, and psychology. Who knows why people do what they do? The point is they do it, and we can track and measure it with unprecedented fidelity. With enough data, the numbers speak for themselves.\nBut big data does not explain anything. Big data merely discloses correlations between things. Correlations are the most primitive form of knowledge. They do not allow us to understand anything. Big data cannot explain why things are correlated in the way they are. It does not establish causal or conceptual connections. The question “why?” is replaced with a non-conceptual “this-is-how-it-is”.\nAs a narrative, theory designs an order of things, setting them in relation to each other. Theory thereby explains why they behave the way they do. It develops conceptual contexts that make things intelligible. Unlike big data, theory offers us the highest form of knowledge: comprehension. Theory is a form of closure that takes hold of things and thereby makes them graspable. Big data, by contrast, is completely open. Theory, as a form of closure, comprises things within a conceptual framework and thus makes them graspable. The end of theory ultimately means the end of concept as spirit [Begriff als Geist]. Artificial intelligence can do without the conceptual. Intelligence is not spirit. Only spirit is capable of a reordering of things, of creating a new narrative. Intelligence computes and counts. Spirit, however, recounts. Data-driven human sciences [Geisteswissenschaften] are not sciences of spirit but data science. Data drive out spirit. Data-knowledge marks the degree zero of spirit. In a world saturated with data and information, our narrative capacity withers. Fewer theories are therefore formulated—no one wants to take the risk of putting forward a theory."

    "text": "Byung-Chul Han, The Crisis of Narration (Hoboken, NJ: Polity Press, 2024)\nOriginally published in German as Die Krise der Narration (Berlin: MSB Matthes & Seitz Berlin Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, 2023).\nIn The Arcades Project, Benjamin remarks:\nHappiness is not a momentary event. It has a long tail that reaches back into the past. Happiness feeds off all that has been part of a life. It does not have a shiny appearance; its appearance is an afterglow. We owe our happiness to the salvation of the past. This salvation requires a narrative tension in which the present integrates the past, thereby making the past a continuing influence, even resurrecting the past. In the state of happiness, salvation reverberates. When everything becomes part of a maelstrom of actuality, a storm of contingency, there can be no happiness for us.\nLife, conceived as a muscle, would have to be enormously strong if men are, as Marcel Proust imagines, temporal beings who ‘spend their lives perched upon living stilts which never cease to grow until sometimes they become taller than church steeples’.2 The end of In Search of Lost Time is anything but triumphant:\nFor Proust, the task of the narrator is to salvage the past:\nIn modernity, life atrophies. The decay of time is a threat to life. In his In Search of Lost Time, Proust is fighting against temporal atrophy, the disappearance of time as a kind of muscular atrophy. Time Regained appeared in 1927, the same year that saw the publication of Heidegger’s Being and Time. Heidegger was also determined to use his writing to fight the temporal atrophy of modernity, the destabilization and fragmentation of life. To the fragmentation and withering of life in modernity he juxtaposes ‘the whole of existence stretched along’ in ‘which Dasein [Heidegger’s ontological term for human beings] as fate “incorporates” into its existence birth and death and their “between”’.5 Human beings do not exist from one moment to the next. They are not momentary beings. Their existence comprises the whole temporal range that opens up between birth and death. In the absence of external orientation and a narrative anchoring in being, the energy to contract the time between birth and death into a living unity that encapsulates all events and occurrences must come from the self. The continuity of being is guaranteed by the continuity of the self. The ‘constancy of the self’ represents the central temporal axis that must protect us against the fragmentation of time.6\nHeidegger claims that Being and Time is an ahistorical analysis of human existence, but it is in fact a reflection of the temporal crisis of modernity. Anxiety, which plays such a prominent role in Being and Time, is part of the pathology of modern man, who no longer has a firm footing in the world. Death itself is no longer integrated into a meaningful narrative of salvation. Rather, it is my death, and I have to deal with it by myself. As death puts an end to my self once and for all, Dasein – in the face of death – contracts into itself. From the constant presence of death comes the pre-eminence of the self. The existential paroxysm of a Dasein that is determined to realize its self generates the necessary tension, the muscular power that protects Dasein against the impending temporal atrophy and provides it with temporal continuity.\nHeidegger’s ‘Being-one’s-Self’ precedes narrative biographical context, which is constructed only later. Dasein assures itself of itself before it creates a coherent worldly story of itself. The self is not constructed out of worldly occurrences that were already connected with each other. ‘Authentic historicality’ is founded only by the pre-narrative ‘whole of existence stretched along’. Against temporal atrophy, Heidegger seeks a temporal framing of existence, the ‘whole of existence stretched along in this historicality in a way which is primordial and not lost, and which has no need of connectedness’.7 This frame has to ensure that Dasein’s pre-narrative unity does not disintegrate into ‘momentary actualities of Experiences which come along successively and disappear’.8 It pulls Dasein out of ‘the endless multiplicity of possibilities which offer themselves as closest to one – those of comfortableness, shirking, and taking things lightly’ – and anchors it in ‘the simplicity of its fate [Schicksals]’.9 Having a fate means properly taking charge of one’s self. Someone who surrenders to the ‘momentary actualities’ has no fate, no ‘authentic historicality’.\nDigitalization intensifies the atrophy of time. Reality disintegrates into information that is relevant only briefly. Information lives on the allure of surprise. It thus fragments time. Our attention also becomes fragmented. Information does not permit any lingering. In the accelerated exchange of information, bits of information quickly replace each other. Snapchat is the embodiment of instant digital communication. This service is the purest expression of digital temporality. Only the moment counts. Snaps are a synonym for ‘momentary actualities’, and accordingly they disappear after a short while. Reality disintegrates into snaps. This removes the temporal anchors that stabilize us. ‘Stories’ on digital platforms such as Instagram or Facebook are not genuine stories. They have no narrative duration. Rather, they are just sequences of momentary impressions that do not tell us anything. They are in fact no more than bits of visual information that quickly disappear. Nothing stays. An Instagram advertisement says: ‘Post moments from your everyday life in your Stories. These are fun, casual, and only last 24 hours.’ This temporal limitation creates a peculiar psychological effect. It evokes a feeling of fleetingness, which produces a subtle compulsion to communicate even more.\nSelfies are momentary photographs. Their only concern is the moment. As a medium of remembrance, a selfie is fleeting visual information. Unlike an analogue photo, it is registered only briefly and then disappears for good. Selfies aim not at remembrance but at communication. Ultimately, they announce the end of the human being as someone with a fate and a history.\nPhono sapiens surrenders to the ‘momentary actualities of Experiences which come along successively and disappear’. The ‘whole of existence stretched along’ – which connects birth and death and gives a life its emphasis on the self – is alien to Phono sapiens, who does not exist historically. The phenomenon of the funeral selfie suggests this absence of death. Standing next to the coffin, people smile at their cameras. Likes can be elicited even from death. Apparently, Phono sapiens moves beyond Homo sapiens, who was in need of salvation.\nWith digital platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Snapchat, we approach the degree zero of narration. They are media of information, not narration. They work in an additive rather than narrative fashion. The strings of information do not condense into a narrative. To the question ‘How do I add or edit a life event on my Facebook profile?’ the answer is: ‘Scroll down to posts and tap life event.’ Life events are mere bits of information. They are not woven into an extended narrative but simply added up into a syndetic arrangement. There is no narrative synthesis of events. On digital platforms, lived moments cannot be digested and condensed in a reflexive and narrative manner – and in fact this is intentional. Digital platforms’ technical dispositif rules out time-intensive narrative practices.\nHuman memory is selective. This is how it differs from a database. It is narrative, whereas digital memories are additive and cumulative. A narrative depends on a selection and connection of events. It proceeds in a selective fashion. The narrative path is narrow. It comprises only selected events. The narrated or remembered life is necessarily incomplete. Digital platforms, by contrast, seek to create a complete record of a life. The less narration there is, the more data and information there are. For digital platforms, data are more valuable than narratives. They do not want narrative reflection. When digital platforms permit narrative formats, these must be designed so as to be compatible with databases. They need to produce as many data as possible. The narrative formats therefore necessarily have an additive form. ‘Stories’ are designed to be bearers of information; narrative, in the genuine sense, disappears. The dispositif of digital platforms is: the total record of a life. The aim is to translate a life into a dataset. The more data there are about a person, the better that person can be surveilled, controlled and economically exploited. Phono sapiens believe they are merely playing, but they are in fact being utterly exploited and controlled. The smartphone seems to be a playground, but it is a digital panopticon.\nCreating an autobiographical narrative requires one to reflect on one’s life – the conscious work of remembrance. Data and information, by contrast, are generated in a way that bypasses consciousness. They represent our activities immediately, without any reflective filtering. If data are produced in a less conscious way, they are accordingly more useful. Such data provide access to those regions that lie outside of consciousness. They allow digital platforms to screen a person and to control their behaviour at a pre-reflexive level.\nWalter Benjamin suggested that, just as psychoanalysis discovers the ‘instinctual unconscious’, the technical possibilities of the camera, such as slow motion, time lapses and close-ups, allow us to discover an ‘optical unconscious’.10 In a similar way, data mining acts as a digital magnifying glass that discloses an unconscious space behind the conscious one. We may call this space the digital unconscious. It allows artificial intelligence to access our unconscious desires and inclinations. This puts data-driven psychopolitics in a position to control our behaviour at a pre-reflexive level.11\nIn the case of so-called ‘self-tracking’, counting completely supplants narration. All that self-tracking generates are data. The motto of the Quantified Self movement is ‘Self-Knowledge through Numbers’. Its adherents try to gain self-knowledge not through narration, remembrance and reflection, but by way of counting and numbers. To this end, the body is fitted with various sensors that automatically generate data on heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, movement and sleep patterns. Mental states and moods are continuously monitored. A detailed log of all everyday activities is kept. Even the day one notices one’s first grey hair is recorded. Nothing must escape the total record of a life. In all this, nothing is narrated. Everything is measured. Sensors and apps provide data automatically, without any linguistic representation or narrative reflection. The collected data are then summarized in visually appealing graphics and diagrams. These, however, do not say anything about who I am. The self is not a quantity but a quality. ‘Self-Knowledge through Numbers’ is an illusion. Self-knowledge can be generated only through narration. I must narrate myself. But numbers do not narrate anything. The expression ‘numerical narratives’ is an oxymoron. A life cannot be captured through quantifiable events.\nThe third episode of the first series of Black Mirror is called ‘The Entire History of You’. It depicts a transparent society in which everyone wears an implant behind the ear that records everything the wearer sees and experiences. Everything that was seen or perceived can be replayed, either directly to the wearer or on an external screen. At airport security checks, for instance, the officer asks you to replay the events of a certain time period. Nothing is secret any more. It is impossible for criminals to hide their crimes. People are, so to speak, captured in their own memories. Strictly speaking, when everything that is experienced can be repeated, remembrance is impossible.\nRemembrance is not a mechanical repetition of an earlier experience but a narrative that must be recounted again and again. Memories necessarily have gaps. They presuppose closeness and distance. When all experience is present and distanceless, that is, when it is available, remembrance is impossible. The gapless repetition of past experience is not a narrative but a report or record. To be able to narrate or remember, one must be able to forget or leave out a great deal. The transparency society spells the end of narrative and remembrance. There is no such thing as a transparent narrative. Only information and data are transparent. In the final scene of ‘The Entire History of You’, the protagonist takes a razor blade to himself, and cuts out the implant.\nReferences"

Tomasena, “Negotiating Collaborations: BookTubers, The Publishing Industry, and YouTube’s Ecosystem”\nSee also:\nAlysia De Melo, “The Influence of BookTok on Literary Criticisms and Diversity”Michael Dezuanni and Amy Schoonens, “#BookTok’s Peer Pedagogies: Invitations to Learn About Books and Reading on TikTok”D. Bondy Valdovinos Kaye, “JazzTok: Creativity, Community, and Improvisation on TikTok,” Jazz and Culture 6 (2) (2023): 92–116.\n\nBookstagram is known for its luxurious aesthetic celebrating the materiality of books … This bookish aesthetic is developed in posts that feature beautifully styled books and bookish objects as well as posts that celebrate reading as desirable activity.\n—Bronwyn Reddan, “Social reading cultures on BookTube, Bookstagram, and BookTok\n\nAre you “bookish”? As you’ll have seen if you’ve read Jessica Maddox and Fiona Gill’s article this week about Booktok (and maybe looked more closely at its references), the term has become ubiquitous in the intersecting worlds of Booktube, Bookstagram, and Booktok, as well as social reading sites like Goodreads. I want to spend some time here reflecting on the concept of bookishness itself. What does it mean to be, or to become, “bookish” anyway? While the term itself long predates social media, of course, it’s taken on a particular meaning and a particular resonance in relation to the representation of books and the practice of reading on social media. In that context, to be “bookish” means quite specifically to participate in what Maddox and Gill refer to as the “digital imagined community” of bibliophiles extending across the social media platforms of YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok. So what does being “bookish” actually mean in that specific context? What exactly is “bookishness” in the context of social media?\nWe could start with the term’s rather odd suffix: ish. In popular usage, the term “-ish” suggests an approximation to something rather than precise definition. “Let’s meet at six-ish” means that we’ll meet around 18:00 hours but not necessarily exactly at that time. But as you know, it’s quite common now in everyday conversation to use the ending “-ish” on its own, detached from a preceding noun, as a kind of shorthand to refer to an approximate state or emotion: “So did you enjoy the movie?” —“Ish”.\nTo be bookish, then, suggests a looser, more casual affiliation with books and compared to that of the professional critic, academic literature scholor, publisher, bookseller, or author. It invokees amateur appreciation rather than scholarly expertise, pleasure rather than literary analysis. Yet because of the high cultural prestige attached to books (what the social theorist Pierre Bourdieu calls symbolic capital) that remains attached to books, to identify as “bookish” is still to claim or perform a certain form of social distinction. In the social media realm, then, “bookishness” becomes a form of non-specialized (at least in the academic sense of specialization) social identity defined—I would argue—not by disciplinary expertise (textual analysis, historical knowledge) but defined purely and simply by an affective relation to its object: what’s often referred to as a passion for books and reading. From this standpoint, we can say first of all that “bookishness” is a form of fandom, and we know how the popular knowledge of fans involves a very different (I would say affective) relation to its object rather than the dispassionate position required of the literary scholar.\nWhat’s equally clear from both of the primary reading assignments for this week is that “bookishness” as a social (media) identity involves not just an affective relation to its object but also a commodified one, that of a consumer. It’s no coincidence that the most common video format of Booktubers and Booktok creators is the recommendation video, with recommendation here involving not just the question of whether a book is worth your time but also your money. As José Miguel Tomasena explains in his article, Booktubers on YouTube and other social platforms play a crucial role in the circulation and promotion of books and authors, similar to that of music or film critics, in a similar way to how fashion or beauty bloggers become “brand ambassadors”. In addition to their overtly commercial role, though, Booktubers also embody the fantasy of “bookishness” through their conspicuous consumption (a term coined by Thorstein Veblen more than a century ago) through their fetishizing of books as material objects and their highly stylized performances and indeed staging of bibliophilia (literally the love of books). In her brilliant analysis of this phenomenon, Bronwyn Radden refers to this as “a bookish aesthetic,” and this aestheticization of books and the practice of reading itself into a self-consciously performed ritual invokes the sociological concept of lifestyle, which could be defined as a form of modern social identity in which in capitalism the modern self is articulated exclusively through commodities and consumption.\nThis bring me to my last point, about aesthetics—a concept that we will be focusing on in depth in the last week of the course. For now, let me conclude by defining “bookishness” as what in social media parlance today is known as an aesthetic. If we consider bookishness in this way, we can see that there are two quite distinct ways of thinking about Booktok. The first is the approach taken by Jessica Maddox and Fiona Gill in their article, where it is contextualized as one of the many “sides” of TikTok (I’ve included a different example of such a “side” below, in Queline Meadows’s superb video essay about Film TikTok; there is also a link in the margin to an article about Jazz TikTok).\nThe other way of thinking about Booktok, which to me makes more sense than its “internal” relationship to other “sides” of TikTok, is to re-frame it as an aesthetic that is not confined to TikTok but extending across not only other platforms (notably YouTube, Instagram, Twitter) but also independent personal blogs such as the one linked to at the beginning of this page. While the bookish aesthetic takes different forms on each of these different platforms according to their particular affordances (YouTube vs. Insta vs. TikTok), they do have much in common. I think it makes more sense to consider bookishness as an **internet aesthetic* and to consider it comparatively across multiple social media platforms for that reason. This is even though there are numerous articles specifically about Booktok in particular, I thought it was important also to consider the bookish aesthetic not just on TikTok but also on YouTube (the Tomasena article) and Instagram (the Redden article, linked at the beginning of this lecture).\nMy argument here may seem a bit strange at this point, given that we are so used to thinking about social media vertically, in terms of platform infrastructures. Even though different platforms may have the same corporate owner, we still tend to approarch social media in this way (see the TikTok Research Network). Methodologically, it makes sense, I suppose, but the drawback is that it may lead us to miss the bigger picture; the concept of aesthetics enables us to connect the pieces of the larger jigsaw puzzle.\nHopefully the preceding discussion will make more sense when return to the topic of aesthetics in the concluding week of the course. For now, I hope what I’ve said makes sense and look forward to hearing about your own relationship to Booktok or the bookish aesthetic on other platforms.\nThere is, of course, a lot more to say about the larger phenomenon of the cult of physical books and reading as a backlash against the domination of digital, virtual, and visual culture. I think it would be simplistic to reduce it simply to nostalgia for analog culture, though, since we must remember that the the bookish aesthetic or subculture is itself a networked public (boyd) or digital imagined community (Anderson).\nI’m embedding and linking some videos and other sources below that connect both to this readings and my own discussion of them here, and encourage you to explore them and share your thoughts about them in your weekly Review post and the discussion channel on Discord.\n\nKey Concepts\n\n“Side” (of TikTok)\nPlatform vernaculars\nImitation publics\nImagined communities\nRecommendation video\n“Bookish” aesthetics\nSocial/symbolic capital (Bourdieu)\n\nFurther Reading\nClaire Armistead, “‘After lockdown, things exploded’ - how TikTok triggered a books revolution (The Guardian, 8 June 2022).\nDorothee Birke,”Social Reading?

Please be aware all FSU faculty members are “mandatory reporters,” which means that if you tell me about a situation involving sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking, I am legally required to share that information with the Title IX Coordinator. If you or someone you know has been impacted by sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating or domestic violence, or stalking, FSU has staff members trained to support you. If you or someone you know has been impacted by sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating or domestic violence, or stalking, please visit http://fitchburgstate.edu/titleix to access information about university support and resources.\n\nHealth\nHealth Services\nHours: Monday-Friday 8:30AM-5PM Location: Ground Level of Russell Towers (across from the entrance of Holmes Dining Hall) Phone: (978) 665-3643/3894\nCounseling Services\nThe Counseling Services Office offers a range of services including individual, couples and group counseling, crisis intervention, psychoeducational programming, outreach ALTERNATIVE ECOSYSTEMSs, and community referrals. Counseling services are confidential and are offered at no charge to all enrolled students. Staff at Counseling Services are also available for consultation to faculty, staff and students. Counseling Services is located in the Hammond, 3rd Floor, Room 317.\nFitchburg Anti-Violence Education (FAVE)\nFAVE collaborates with a number of community partners (e.g., YWCA Domestic Violence Services, Pathways for Change) to meet our training needs and to link survivors with community based resources. This site also features resources for help or information about dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking. If you or someone you know is in an abusive relationship or has been a victim of sexual assault, there are many places to go for help. Many can be accessed 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. On campus, free and confidential support is provided at both Counseling Services and Health Services.\nCommunity Food Pantry  Food insecurity is a growing issue and it certainly can affect student learning. The ability to have access to nutritious food is incredibly vital. The Falcon Bazaar, located in Hammond G 15, is stocked with food, basic necessities, and can provide meal swipes to support all Fitchburg State students experiencing food insecurity for a day or a semester.\nThe university continues to partner with Our Father’s House to support student needs and access to food and services. All Fitchburg State University students are welcome at the Our Father’s House Community Food Pantry. This Pantry is located at the Faith Christian Church at 40 Boutelle St., Fitchburg, MA and is open from 5-7pm. Each “household” may shop for nutritious food once per month by presenting a valid FSU ID.\n\nAcademic Integrity\nThe University “Academic Integrity” policy can be found online at http:// www.fitchburgstate.edu/offices-services-directory/office-of-student-conductmediation-education/academic-integrity/. Students are expected to do their own work. Plagiarism and cheating are inexcusable. Any instance of plagiarism or cheating will automatically result in a zero on the assignment and may be reported the Office of Student and Academic Life at the discretion of the instructor.\nPlagiarism includes, but is not limited to: - Using papers or work from another class. - Using another student’s paper or work from any class. - Copying work or a paper from the Internet. - The egregious lack of citing sources or documenting research.\nIf you’re not clear on what is or is not plagiarism, ASK. The BEST case scenario if caught is a zero on that assignment, and ignorance of what does or does not count is not an excuse. That being said, I’m a strong supporter of Fair Use doctrine. Just attribute what you use–and, again, ASK if there’s any doubt.\nAmericans With Disabilities Act (ADA)\n\nIf you need course adaptations or accommodations because of a disability, if you have emergency medical information to share with the instructor, or if you need special arrangements in case the building must be evacuated, please inform the faculty member as soon as possible.\n\nTechnology\nAt some point during the semester you will likely have a problem with technology. Your laptop will crash; your iPad battery will die; a recording you make will disappear; you will accidentally delete a file; the wireless will go down at a crucial time. These, however, are inevitabilities of life, not emergences. Technology problems are not excuses for unfinished or late work. Bad things may happen, but you can protect yourself by doing the following:\n\nPlan ahead: A deadline is the last minute to turn in material. You can start—and finish—early, particularly if challenging resources are required, or you know it will be time consuming to finish this project.\nSave work early and often: Think how much work you do in 10 minutes. I auto save every 2 minutes.\nMake regular backups of files in a different location: Between Box, Google Drive, Dropbox, and iCloud, you have ample places to store and backup your materials. Use them.\nSave drafts: When editing, set aside the original and work with a copy.\nPractice safe computing: On your personal devices, install and use software to control viruses and malware.\n\n\nGrading\nGrading for the course will follow the FSU grading policy below:\n4.0: 95-100\n3.7: 92-94\n3.5: 89-91\n3.3: 86-88\n3.0: 83-85\n2.7: 80-82\n2.5: 77-79\n2.3: 74-76\n2.0: 71-73\n0.0: &lt; 70\n\nAcademic Resources\nWriting Center\nAcademic Policies\nDisability Services\nFitchburg State Alert system for emergencies, snow closures/delays, and faculty absences\nUniversity Career Services"
