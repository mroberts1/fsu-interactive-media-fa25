    "text": "Policies\nLate Policy\nAssignments that are late will lose 1/2 of a grade per day, beginning at the end of class and including weekends and holidays. This means that a paper, which would have received an A if it was on time, will receive a B+ the next day, B- for two days late, and so on. Time management, preparation for our meetings, and timely submission of your work comprise a significant dimension of your professionalism. As such, your work must be completed by the beginning of class on the day it is due. If you have a serious problem that makes punctual submission impossible, you must discuss this matter with me before the due date so that we can make alternative arrangements. Because you are given plenty of time to complete your work, and major due dates are given to you well in advance, last minute problems should not preclude handing in assignments on time.\n\nMandatory Reporter\nFitchburg State University is committed to providing a safe learning environment for all students that is free of all forms of discrimination and harassment. Please be aware all FSU faculty members are “mandatory reporters,” which means that if you tell me about a situation involving sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking, I am legally required to share that information with the Title IX Coordinator. If you or someone you know has been impacted by sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating or domestic violence, or stalking, FSU has staff members trained to support you. If you or someone you know has been impacted by sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating or domestic violence, or stalking, please visit http://fitchburgstate.edu/titleix to access information about university support and resources.\n\nHealth\nHealth Services\nHours: Monday-Friday 8:30AM-5PM Location: Ground Level of Russell Towers (across from the entrance of Holmes Dining Hall) Phone: (978) 665-3643/3894\nCounseling Services\nThe Counseling Services Office offers a range of services including individual, couples and group counseling, crisis intervention, psychoeducational programming, outreach ALTERNATIVE ECOSYSTEMSs, and community referrals. Counseling services are confidential and are offered at no charge to all enrolled students. Staff at Counseling Services are also available for consultation to faculty, staff and students. Counseling Services is located in the Hammond, 3rd Floor, Room 317.\nFitchburg Anti-Violence Education (FAVE)\nFAVE collaborates with a number of community partners (e.g., YWCA Domestic Violence Services, Pathways for Change) to meet our training needs and to link survivors with community based resources. This site also features resources for help or information about dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking. If you or someone you know is in an abusive relationship or has been a victim of sexual assault, there are many places to go for help. Many can be accessed 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. On campus, free and confidential support is provided at both Counseling Services and Health Services.\nCommunity Food Pantry  Food insecurity is a growing issue and it certainly can affect student learning. The ability to have access to nutritious food is incredibly vital. The Falcon Bazaar, located in Hammond G 15, is stocked with food, basic necessities, and can provide meal swipes to support all Fitchburg State students experiencing food insecurity for a day or a semester.\nThe university continues to partner with Our Father’s House to support student needs and access to food and services. All Fitchburg State University students are welcome at the Our Father’s House Community Food Pantry. This Pantry is located at the Faith Christian Church at 40 Boutelle St., Fitchburg, MA and is open from 5-7pm. Each “household” may shop for nutritious food once per month by presenting a valid FSU ID.\n\nAcademic Integrity\nThe University “Academic Integrity” policy can be found online at http:// www.fitchburgstate.edu/offices-services-directory/office-of-student-conductmediation-education/academic-integrity/. Students are expected to do their own work. Plagiarism and cheating are inexcusable. Any instance of plagiarism or cheating will automatically result in a zero on the assignment and may be reported the Office of Student and Academic Life at the discretion of the instructor.\nPlagiarism includes, but is not limited to: - Using papers or work from another class. - Using another student’s paper or work from any class. - Copying work or a paper from the Internet. - The egregious lack of citing sources or documenting research.\nIf you’re not clear on what is or is not plagiarism, ASK. The BEST case scenario if caught is a zero on that assignment, and ignorance of what does or does not count is not an excuse. That being said, I’m a strong supporter of Fair Use doctrine. Just attribute what you use–and, again, ASK if there’s any doubt.\nAmericans With Disabilities Act (ADA)\n\nIf you need course adaptations or accommodations because of a disability, if you have emergency medical information to share with the instructor, or if you need special arrangements in case the building must be evacuated, please inform the faculty member as soon as possible.\n\nTechnology\nAt some point during the semester you will likely have a problem with technology. Your laptop will crash; your iPad battery will die; a recording you make will disappear; you will accidentally delete a file; the wireless will go down at a crucial time. These, however, are inevitabilities of life, not emergences. Technology problems are not excuses for unfinished or late work. Bad things may happen, but you can protect yourself by doing the following:\n\nPlan ahead: A deadline is the last minute to turn in material. You can start—and finish—early, particularly if challenging resources are required, or you know it will be time consuming to finish this project.\nSave work early and often: Think how much work you do in 10 minutes. I auto save every 2 minutes.\nMake regular backups of files in a different location: Between Box, Google Drive, Dropbox, and iCloud, you have ample places to store and backup your materials. Use them.\nSave drafts: When editing, set aside the original and work with a copy.\nPractice safe computing: On your personal devices, install and use software to control viruses and malware.\n\n\nGrading\nGrading for the course will follow the FSU grading policy below:\n4.0: 95-100\n3.7: 92-94\n3.5: 89-91\n3.3: 86-88\n3.0: 83-85\n2.7: 80-82\n2.5: 77-79\n2.3: 74-76\n2.0: 71-73\n0.0: &lt; 70\n\nAcademic Resources\nWriting Center\nAcademic Policies\nDisability Services\nFitchburg State Alert system for emergencies, snow closures/delays, and faculty absences\nUniversity Career Services"

Tomasena, “Negotiating Collaborations: BookTubers, The Publishing Industry, and YouTube’s Ecosystem”\nSee also:\nAlysia De Melo, “The Influence of BookTok on Literary Criticisms and Diversity”Michael Dezuanni and Amy Schoonens, “#BookTok’s Peer Pedagogies: Invitations to Learn About Books and Reading on TikTok”D. Bondy Valdovinos Kaye, “JazzTok: Creativity, Community, and Improvisation on TikTok,” Jazz and Culture 6 (2) (2023): 92–116.\n\nBookstagram is known for its luxurious aesthetic celebrating the materiality of books … This bookish aesthetic is developed in posts that feature beautifully styled books and bookish objects as well as posts that celebrate reading as desirable activity.\n—Bronwyn Reddan, “Social reading cultures on BookTube, Bookstagram, and BookTok\n\nAre you “bookish”? As you’ll have seen if you’ve read Jessica Maddox and Fiona Gill’s article this week about Booktok (and maybe looked more closely at its references), the term has become ubiquitous in the intersecting worlds of Booktube, Bookstagram, and Booktok, as well as social reading sites like Goodreads. I want to spend some time here reflecting on the concept of bookishness itself. What does it mean to be, or to become, “bookish” anyway? While the term itself long predates social media, of course, it’s taken on a particular meaning and a particular resonance in relation to the representation of books and the practice of reading on social media. In that context, to be “bookish” means quite specifically to participate in what Maddox and Gill refer to as the “digital imagined community” of bibliophiles extending across the social media platforms of YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok. So what does being “bookish” actually mean in that specific context? What exactly is “bookishness” in the context of social media?\nWe could start with the term’s rather odd suffix: ish. In popular usage, the term “-ish” suggests an approximation to something rather than precise definition. “Let’s meet at six-ish” means that we’ll meet around 18:00 hours but not necessarily exactly at that time. But as you know, it’s quite common now in everyday conversation to use the ending “-ish” on its own, detached from a preceding noun, as a kind of shorthand to refer to an approximate state or emotion: “So did you enjoy the movie?” —“Ish”.\nTo be bookish, then, suggests a looser, more casual affiliation with books and compared to that of the professional critic, academic literature scholor, publisher, bookseller, or author. It invokees amateur appreciation rather than scholarly expertise, pleasure rather than literary analysis. Yet because of the high cultural prestige attached to books (what the social theorist Pierre Bourdieu calls symbolic capital) that remains attached to books, to identify as “bookish” is still to claim or perform a certain form of social distinction. In the social media realm, then, “bookishness” becomes a form of non-specialized (at least in the academic sense of specialization) social identity defined—I would argue—not by disciplinary expertise (textual analysis, historical knowledge) but defined purely and simply by an affective relation to its object: what’s often referred to as a passion for books and reading. From this standpoint, we can say first of all that “bookishness” is a form of fandom, and we know how the popular knowledge of fans involves a very different (I would say affective) relation to its object rather than the dispassionate position required of the literary scholar.\nWhat’s equally clear from both of the primary reading assignments for this week is that “bookishness” as a social (media) identity involves not just an affective relation to its object but also a commodified one, that of a consumer. It’s no coincidence that the most common video format of Booktubers and Booktok creators is the recommendation video, with recommendation here involving not just the question of whether a book is worth your time but also your money. As José Miguel Tomasena explains in his article, Booktubers on YouTube and other social platforms play a crucial role in the circulation and promotion of books and authors, similar to that of music or film critics, in a similar way to how fashion or beauty bloggers become “brand ambassadors”. In addition to their overtly commercial role, though, Booktubers also embody the fantasy of “bookishness” through their conspicuous consumption (a term coined by Thorstein Veblen more than a century ago) through their fetishizing of books as material objects and their highly stylized performances and indeed staging of bibliophilia (literally the love of books). In her brilliant analysis of this phenomenon, Bronwyn Radden refers to this as “a bookish aesthetic,” and this aestheticization of books and the practice of reading itself into a self-consciously performed ritual invokes the sociological concept of lifestyle, which could be defined as a form of modern social identity in which in capitalism the modern self is articulated exclusively through commodities and consumption.\nThis bring me to my last point, about aesthetics—a concept that we will be focusing on in depth in the last week of the course. For now, let me conclude by defining “bookishness” as what in social media parlance today is known as an aesthetic. If we consider bookishness in this way, we can see that there are two quite distinct ways of thinking about Booktok. The first is the approach taken by Jessica Maddox and Fiona Gill in their article, where it is contextualized as one of the many “sides” of TikTok (I’ve included a different example of such a “side” below, in Queline Meadows’s superb video essay about Film TikTok; there is also a link in the margin to an article about Jazz TikTok).\nThe other way of thinking about Booktok, which to me makes more sense than its “internal” relationship to other “sides” of TikTok, is to re-frame it as an aesthetic that is not confined to TikTok but extending across not only other platforms (notably YouTube, Instagram, Twitter) but also independent personal blogs such as the one linked to at the beginning of this page. While the bookish aesthetic takes different forms on each of these different platforms according to their particular affordances (YouTube vs. Insta vs. TikTok), they do have much in common. I think it makes more sense to consider bookishness as an **internet aesthetic* and to consider it comparatively across multiple social media platforms for that reason. This is even though there are numerous articles specifically about Booktok in particular, I thought it was important also to consider the bookish aesthetic not just on TikTok but also on YouTube (the Tomasena article) and Instagram (the Redden article, linked at the beginning of this lecture).\nMy argument here may seem a bit strange at this point, given that we are so used to thinking about social media vertically, in terms of platform infrastructures. Even though different platforms may have the same corporate owner, we still tend to approarch social media in this way (see the TikTok Research Network). Methodologically, it makes sense, I suppose, but the drawback is that it may lead us to miss the bigger picture; the concept of aesthetics enables us to connect the pieces of the larger jigsaw puzzle.\nHopefully the preceding discussion will make more sense when return to the topic of aesthetics in the concluding week of the course. For now, I hope what I’ve said makes sense and look forward to hearing about your own relationship to Booktok or the bookish aesthetic on other platforms.\nThere is, of course, a lot more to say about the larger phenomenon of the cult of physical books and reading as a backlash against the domination of digital, virtual, and visual culture. I think it would be simplistic to reduce it simply to nostalgia for analog culture, though, since we must remember that the the bookish aesthetic or subculture is itself a networked public (boyd) or digital imagined community (Anderson).\nI’m embedding and linking some videos and other sources below that connect both to this readings and my own discussion of them here, and encourage you to explore them and share your thoughts about them in your weekly Review post and the discussion channel on Discord.\n\nKey Concepts\n\n“Side” (of TikTok)\nPlatform vernaculars\nImitation publics\nImagined communities\nRecommendation video\n“Bookish” aesthetics\nSocial/symbolic capital (Bourdieu)\n\nFurther Reading\nClaire Armistead, “‘After lockdown, things exploded’ - how TikTok triggered a books revolution (The Guardian, 8 June 2022).\nDorothee Birke,”Social Reading?
